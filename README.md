Heart Disease Detection
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect the risk of heart disease based on various health factors.

Dataset Overview
Age: The age of the individual in years.
Sex: Gender of the individual (M for Male, F for Female).
ChestPainType: Type of chest pain the individual experiences (e.g., ATA - Atypical Angina).
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar level (0 indicates less than 120 mg/dl, 1 indicates greater than 120 mg/dl).
RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (e.g., Normal, ST-T wave abnormality).
MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
ExerciseAngina: Whether the individual experiences angina (chest pain) during exercise (Y for Yes, N for No).
Oldpeak: Depression of the ST segment, indicating a possible heart disease.
ST_Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (e.g., Up, Flat, Down).
HeartDisease: Target variable indicating if the individual has heart disease (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
Key Steps Involved
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to identify key features influencing heart disease risk.
Analyzed the relationship between various health factors and the likelihood of developing heart disease.
Visualized trends using Python, with libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Correlation Analysis:

Identified a strong correlation between high cholesterol, age, and high blood pressure with the likelihood of heart disease.
Visualization:

Visualized the key trends and patterns using graphs and plots to better understand the dataset and make informed decisions on predictive modeling.
Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook: For writing and executing Python code.
Python: Programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
Results
Through data analysis, I found significant correlations between several factors like cholesterol levels, age, and blood pressure with the likelihood of developing heart disease.
