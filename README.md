# Heart Disease Detection

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect the risk of heart disease based on various health factors.

## Dataset Overview

1. *Age*: The age of the individual in years.
2. *Sex*: Gender of the individual (M for Male, F for Female).
3. *ChestPainType*: Type of chest pain the individual experiences (e.g., ATA - Atypical Angina).
4. *RestingBP*: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
5. *Cholesterol*: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
6. *FastingBS*: Fasting blood sugar level (0 indicates less than 120 mg/dl, 1 indicates greater than 120 mg/dl).
7. *RestingECG*: Resting electrocardiographic results (e.g., Normal, ST-T wave abnormality).
8. *MaxHR*: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
9. *ExerciseAngina*: Whether the individual experiences angina (chest pain) during exercise (Y for Yes, N for No).
10. *Oldpeak*: Depression of the ST segment, indicating a possible heart disease.
11. *ST_Slope*: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (e.g., Up, Flat, Down).
12. *HeartDisease*: Target variable indicating if the individual has heart disease (0 for No, 1 for Yes).

## Key Steps Involved

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: 
   - Conducted EDA to identify key features influencing heart disease risk.
   - Analyzed the relationship between various health factors and the likelihood of developing heart disease.
   - Visualized trends using *Python, with libraries such as **Matplotlib* and *Seaborn*.

2. *Correlation Analysis*: 
   - Identified a strong correlation between *high cholesterol, **age, and **high blood pressure* with the likelihood of heart disease.

3. *Visualization*: 
   - Visualized the key trends and patterns using graphs and plots to better understand the dataset and make informed decisions on predictive modeling.

## Tools Used

- *Jupyter Notebook*: For writing and executing Python code.
- *Python*: Programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- *Matplotlib*: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- *Seaborn*: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

## Results

Through data analysis, I found significant correlations between several factors like cholesterol levels, age, and blood pressure with the likelihood of developing heart disease.
