Heart Disease Detection
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to detect and predict the risk of heart disease based on various health factors.

Project Overview
In this project, the goal was to identify key risk factors for heart disease (such as high cholesterol, age, and high blood pressure) and develop a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence.

Key Steps Involved
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to identify key features influencing heart disease risk.
Analyzed the relationship between various health factors and the likelihood of developing heart disease.
Visualized trends using Python, with libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Correlation Analysis:

Identified a strong correlation between high cholesterol, age, and high blood pressure with the likelihood of heart disease.
Visualization:

Visualized the key trends and patterns using graphs and plots to better understand the dataset and make informed decisions on predictive modeling.
Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook: For writing and executing Python code.
Python: Programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
Results
Through data analysis, I found significant correlations between several factors like cholesterol levels, age, and blood pressure with the likelihood of developing heart disease.
